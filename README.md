## Hiiii :3 

I'm Schrottkatze, a german hacker working on too many things.

Some of which are:

- [Our nix configurations](https://forge.katzen.cafe/schrottkatze/nix-configs)
- [iOwO, a set of langdev libraries and a programming language for image processing](https://forge.katzen.cafe/katzen-cafe/iowo)
- [...and some more which can be viewed on our personal forgejo instance!](https://forge.katzen.cafe/schrottkatze)

I do a lot of rust things, enjoy working with a lot of media- and game related things and so, so much more!

Note about our activity: I mostly work on my personal forgejo instance, therefor most activity doesn't show here.
